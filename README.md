# Specifications_REST
> RESTful Web API specifications for the course examples

Informal base specifications and OpenAPI models developed during the course lectures.
 
## Usage

This repository contains the *sample specifications* developed during the lectures of the  [**Sviluppo Web Avanzato course**](https://sviluppowebavanzato-univaq.github.io)

The content is organized in folders corresponding to academic years (i.e., 2021 means academic year 2021/2022). 
You should only look at the files belonging to your year, since in previous editions there may be files with similar name but
different content, not aligned with the lectures you attended.

The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 4th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*
