> RESTful Web API specifications for the course examples

Informal base specifications and OpenAPI models developed during the course lectures.
 
## Usage

This is a *sample specification* developed during the lectures of the  [**Sviluppo Web Avanzato course**](https://sviluppowebavanzato-univaq.github.io). The code is organized to best match the lecture topics and examples. It is not intended for production use and is not optimized in any way. 

*This example code will be shown and described approximately during the 4th lecture of the course, so wait to download it, since it may get updated in the meanwhile.*
